      <h1>ClubHub Feature Roadmap</h1>
      <p>We're presenting at the 2025 Engineering Expo, but our project doesn't end there.
         We have major features on the horizon that will help clubs and organizations around the world.
         Along with constant bug fixes and quality of life improvements, see some of our big goals to 
         make ClubHub the most productive platform for your club. Follow along for updates!</p>

              <h3>Forms and Affiliations</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              One critical feature that we're adding first is custom forms built into the platform. 
              From club membership, event registration, polls, and more, custom forms are going to be a superpower for club communications.
              <br><br>
              Right behind forms is Affiliations: our main differentiator and the root of our business model.
              Large organizations like universities, residencies, companies, and international associations, will often
              have many clubs who identify or "affiliate" with them. To them, we offer the most effective way to manage
              communications and transactions with their affiliated clubs.

              <h3>Synchronous Updates, Notifications, and Emails</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              Going back to club productivity, we're taking an early step to add real-time collaboration features
              and responsive notifications throughout the app. Beyond this, we know that not everything will be 
              most useful through ClubHub, so we're opening communication options up to emails and more.

              <h3>Integrations with Common Tools</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              Budding off that, we're adding integrations for commonly used tools such as Discord, Zoom, Microsoft and Google suites.
              Mirror your club events to your Discord server, schedule zoom meetings automatically, and populate your calendar.

              <h3>Finance Tracking and Cloud Storage Management</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              After we have basic integrations in place, we will be catering them towards the tasks you need to complete as a club officer.
              Cloud storage management, with permission management and dynamic displays, will be huge for productivity. We're still brainstorming
              on finance tracking, but we know money is hard, so we're trying to do most of the hard stuff for you.

              <h3>Search & Custom Shortcuts</h3>
            </header>
            <p>
              Hopefully you've picked up on a theme here. Our goal is to make this platform the most productive place it can be for managing clubs.
              We know that our search system is one of the most critical parts to the usability of the platform, so we are working to optimize our
              algorithms and add custom shortcuts for easy navigation.
